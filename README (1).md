# 3D Generation from Text or Image using SHAP-E

This project leverages OpenAI's [SHAP-E](https://github.com/openai/shap-e) model to convert text prompts or images into 3D models in `.obj` format. It includes background removal for cleaner image inputs and 3D mesh visualization using `trimesh`.

## ðŸ”§ Steps to Run

1. **Clone SHAP-E Repository (if needed):**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/openai/shap-e
   cd shap-e
   pip install -e .
   ```

2. **Install Required Libraries:**
   ```bash
   pip install torch rembg trimesh onnxruntime
   ```

3. **Run the Script:**
   ```bash
   python shap-e21.py
   ```

4. **Follow Prompts:**
   - For **text-to-3D**: input your prompt.
   - For **image-to-3D**: provide the image path and output directory.
   - At the end, specify the path to a `.obj` file to visualize the mesh.

## ðŸ“š Libraries Used

- `torch` â€“ runs models on CPU/GPU.
- `rembg` â€“ removes backgrounds from input images.
- `trimesh` â€“ displays generated 3D meshes.
- `onnxruntime` â€“ supports SHAP-E model execution.
- `shap-e` â€“ OpenAI's core 3D generation library.

## ðŸ§  Thought Process

This project was designed to offer a streamlined interface for converting both text and images into 3D models using OpenAI's SHAP-E. For **text-to-3D**, a simple prompt is passed to a pretrained text model (`text300M`) which generates a 3D representation through a diffusion-based sampling process. For **image-to-3D**, the image first goes through background removal to isolate the object of interestâ€”this improves the modelâ€™s focus and output quality. The cleaned image is then processed by the image model (`image300M`) to produce the 3D mesh. In both cases, the final output is saved as a `.obj` file, and can be easily visualized using `trimesh`.
